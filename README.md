# Blog README
Written by Ethan Dang for CPSC 354.

This blog is meant to serve as a tutorial for Haskell. 

In this blog I talk about
    1. How to install Haskell, BNFC and more
    2. Ways to get into and learn more about Haskell (Projects, videos, websites etc.)
    3. My personal experience working through Haskell on assignments and   personal projects. (I will talk about the projects I have worked on with Haskell, issues I ran into, how I fixed them, and any other interesting observations I made. I hope this can serve partially as a tutorial or practice while also giving advice on issues one may run into.)
    4. Issues I ran into when working on Haskell and I solved them
