# Blog README
Written by Ethan Dang for CPSC 354.

This blog is meant to serve as a tutorial for Haskell. 

In this blog I talk about:

1. How to install Haskell, BNFC and more

2. Basics of Haskell including
    
    - Syntax
    - Numbers
    - Functions and Pattern Matching
    - Lists and Ranges
    - List Comprehension
    - Types and Type Classes

3. My personal experience working through Haskell on assignments and personal projects. (I will talk about the projects I have worked on with Haskell and any other interesting observations I made. I hope this can serve partially as a tutorial or practice while also giving advice on issues one may run into.)

4. Issues I ran into when working in Haskell and how I solved them
